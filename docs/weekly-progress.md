## Week 1

**Branch:** `asma-week-01`
**PR link:** https://github.com/AI-Security-Internships-2026/02-soc-copilot-threat-analysis/pull/1

### Completed this week
- [x] Read README and proposal
- [x] Set up local environment (Python venv, dependencies)
- [x] Wrote personal introduction (below)
- [x] Identified 3 related papers / tools / datasets
- [x] Run starter script (`python src/main.py`) — confirmed working

### Personal Introduction
I'm Asma, a third-year BS Computer Science student at NUST SEECS, Islamabad. My background is in Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, LangChain, and the Groq API, with projects spanning anomaly detection, LLM-based apps, and graph-based systems. I'm particularly interested in how LLMs can assist SOC analysts in alert triage and threat correlation. Through this internship I hope to build practical experience in AI-assisted blue team operations and understand real-world SOC workflows.

### Problems / Blockers
System defaulted to Python 2.7 via pyenv — resolved by using `python3 -m venv venv` instead.

### Next week plan
- Read the 5 papers identified this week
- Complete `docs/proposal.md` draft
- Set up dataset download / preprocessing pipeline

## Week 2

**Branch:** `asma-week-02`
**PR link:** _[Add link after opening PR]_

### Completed this week
- [x] Created `asma-week-02` branch from `dev`
- [x] Drafted `docs/proposal.md` (problem statement, research questions, methodology)
- [x] Built GUIDE dataset schema reference + synthetic sample generator (for local dev without the full Kaggle download)
- [x] Built data loader + preprocessing pipeline (feature engineering, encoding)
- [x] Built baseline Random Forest triage classifier (TP/BP/FP) with eval metrics
- [x] Wired `src/main.py` to run the full pipeline end to end — confirmed working
- [ ] Expand literature review to 10 papers/tools (in progress)
- [ ] Real GUIDE dataset download/preprocessing pipeline (currently running on synthetic sample)

### Problems / Blockers
Hit a merge conflict in `docs/weekly-progress.md` after stashing local changes across a branch switch — resolved by manually merging the conflicting "Next week plan" section.

### Next week plan
- Continue triage agent implementation (LangGraph)
- Architecture design doc (due Week 3)
- Expand literature review toward 10 papers/tools (carried over)
