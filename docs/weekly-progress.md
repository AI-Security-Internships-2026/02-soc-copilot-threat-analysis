## Week 1

**Branch:** `asma-week-01`
**PR link:** https://github.com/AI-Security-Internships-2026/02-soc-copilot-threat-analysis/pull/1

### Completed this week
- [x] Read README and proposal
- [x] Set up local environment (Python venv, dependencies)
- [x] Wrote personal introduction (below)
- [x] Identified 3 related papers / tools / datasets
- [x] Run starter script (`python src/main.py`) — confirmed working

### Personal Introduction
I'm Asma, a third-year BS Computer Science student at NUST SEECS, Islamabad. My background is in Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, LangChain, and the Groq API, with projects spanning anomaly detection, LLM-based apps, and graph-based systems. I'm particularly interested in how LLMs can assist SOC analysts in alert triage and threat correlation. Through this internship I hope to build practical experience in AI-assisted blue team operations and understand real-world SOC workflows.

### Problems / Blockers
System defaulted to Python 2.7 via pyenv — resolved by using `python3 -m venv venv` instead.

### Next week plan
- Read the 5 papers identified this week
- Complete `docs/proposal.md` draft
- Set up dataset download / preprocessing pipeline

---

## Week 2

**Branch:** `asma-week-02`
**PR link:** _[Add link after opening PR]_

### Completed this week
- [x] Created `asma-week-02` branch from `dev`
- [x] Drafted `docs/proposal.md` (problem statement, research questions, methodology)
- [x] Built GUIDE dataset schema reference + synthetic sample generator (for local dev without the full Kaggle download)
- [x] Built data loader + preprocessing pipeline (feature engineering, encoding)
- [x] Built baseline Random Forest triage classifier (TP/BP/FP) with eval metrics
- [x] Wired `src/main.py` to run the full pipeline end to end — confirmed working
- [ ] Expand literature review to 10 papers/tools (in progress)
- [ ] Real GUIDE dataset download/preprocessing pipeline (currently running on synthetic sample)

### Problems / Blockers
Hit a merge conflict in `docs/weekly-progress.md` after stashing local changes across a branch switch — resolved by manually merging the conflicting "Next week plan" section.

### Next week plan
- Continue triage agent implementation (LangGraph)
- Architecture design doc (due Week 3)
- Expand literature review toward 10 papers/tools (carried over)

## Week 3

**Branch:** `asma-week-03`
**PR link:** https://github.com/AI-Security-Internships-2026/02-soc-copilot-threat-analysis/pull/3

### Completed this week
- [x] Built 3-node LangGraph pipeline: `build_context` → `classify_with_llm` → `parse_verdict`
- [x] Switched LLM backend to Groq (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) after hitting OpenAI quota limits
- [x] Structured JSON-only prompting for reliable verdict/confidence/reasoning parsing
- [x] Ran agent evaluation on synthetic sample: macro F1 0.347 vs RF baseline 0.296 (+0.051), with zero training data
- [x] Fixed categorical column auto-detection bug in `preprocess.py` (`df.select_dtypes(include="object")`)
- [x] Fixed import name mismatch in `evaluate.py`
- [x] Expanded literature review to 10 entries

### Problems / Blockers
PR #3 was accidentally merged into `main` instead of `dev`. Dr. Rana approved it anyway, but this needs to be corrected in Week 4 by targeting `dev` for all future PRs.

### Next week plan (per Dr. Rana's feedback)
- Add human-review checkpoint node with conditional routing
- Test on the real GUIDE dataset (not just the synthetic sample)

---

## Week 4

**Branch:** `asma-week-04`
**PR link:** _[Add link after opening PR — target `dev`, not `main`]_

### Completed this week
- [x] Added human-review checkpoint node with conditional routing — alerts with confidence != "high" get flagged (`needs_human_review: True`) and routed through a review node instead of auto-closing
- [x] Built MITRE ATT&CK RAG integration — new `fetch_mitre_context` node looks up real technique descriptions from the MITRE ATT&CK dataset and injects them into the LLM's prompt context
- [x] Built Streamlit demo UI (`src/app.py`) — paste alert fields, click "run triage", see verdict/confidence/reasoning/review flag
- [x] Fixed baseline accuracy key bug in `evaluate.py` (was looking for `"accuracy"` at the top level; actual key is nested under `"classification_report"`)
- [x] Added CLI args (`--sample-size`, `--output`) to `evaluate.py` for flexible evaluation runs
- [x] Ran full evaluation on real GUIDE dataset (300 rows, stratified across all 3 classes) — results below
- [x] Updated literature review date and fixed remaining placeholder details
- [x] Updated `datasets/README.md` download date placeholder

### Results — real GUIDE dataset (300 rows, 100 per class)

| Metric | RF baseline | Week 3 agent (synthetic) | Week 4 agent (real data) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.374 | 0.375 | 0.400 |
| Macro F1 | 0.296 | 0.347 | 0.386 |

Agent beats RF baseline by +0.090 macro F1 on real data — an improvement over the +0.051 margin seen on the synthetic sample in Week 3.

Per-class breakdown: BenignPositive has high precision (0.64) but low recall (0.21) — the agent is often correct when it says "benign" but misses a lot of actual benign cases, likely misclassifying them as FalsePositive (which shows the opposite pattern: 0.34 precision, 0.61 recall).

### Problems / Blockers
None blocking — the real-data evaluation confirmed the agent generalizes well beyond the synthetic sample.

### Next week plan
- Investigate the BenignPositive/FalsePositive confusion pattern — possibly a prompt refinement
- Continue expanding real-dataset evaluation to a larger sample if time allows
- Address any remaining supervisor feedback from Week 4 PR review
